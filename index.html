              <p>This is a closeup of a drawing I made recently. I do a combination of traditional and digital work. I like drawing on paper often, then I scan it and touch it up digitally. I also do digital art in Procreate and Krita on desktop, I used to use photoshop but my license expired. This goes without saying but none of my work involves AI.</p>
              <p>I am inspired by anime, manga, games, and film. A good film I watched recently was Pulse (Kairo) by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Additionally I saw two interesting documentaries: Inside the Mind of Google by CNBC in 2009 and Helvetica, directed by Gary Hustwit, from 2007.<p>

            <h3>8 facts relevant to BCC</h3>
            
            <ol>
              <li>I am studying here to get an associate's degree in web development. I am nearing the end of my second semester, so I'm about halfway through.</li>
              <li>I work at the help desk in the Sidney Silverman library.</li>
              <li>I like to start my work days with cold brew coffee from the downstairs cafe.</li>
              <li>My favorite place to go on campus is the cafeteria during sunset. I like the big windows. I feel like the rennovations have done a bit of a disservice to the original architecture of this building, which I admire. I also like the Science wing on the ground floor. I like the color scheme of that part of campus.</li>
              <li>Of the things I do for my job here I like doing cable management the most. It's fun and rewarding.</li>
              <li>Of the classes I have taken so far I enjoyed my intro to networking class from my first semester the most, I actually wish I'd been more attentive in retrospect.</li>
              <li>I drive to campus (I have to) but I'm a public transit lover at heart. Mostly because I think it's safer than driving, and I'm more accustomed to it after living in NYC for 8 years and then moving back in with my parents. When I move into a new apartment I'm going to try to find a place that is within reasonable public transit distance from BCC.</li>
              <li>I'm taking a Java class, originally I wanted to take the C/C++ class but it filled up. As someone who uses JavaScript and not Java - After learning a little Java, the more I think about it the more I see JavaScript as a sort of cursive of Java. It's like if Java and Python had a baby.</li>
              <li>Bonus fact: When I was helping out with some stuff I got some free hard drives. Most people think HDDs are obselete but they are actually easier to recover data frame when they break as compared to Solid State drives. Anyways, I've been using them to back up dvds.</li>

            <h3>career outline</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <i><b>foundation</b></i> &bull; First of all, I need to finish my degree. I'm about halfway through that.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <i><b>develop skills</b></i> &bull; The skills required for my future career in web development include familiarizing myself with graphic design, some ui frameworks as well as some backend knowledge. I already have a comprehensive understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I need to get better at making pretty websites, I know too much coding but not enough design knowledge (at least I think so, I'm not as confident with graphic design or web design.)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <i><b>gain experience</b></i> &bull; Currently I work as a student worker at the help desk. Ideally I want to get another help desk job but preferably part time. And, eventually, have a job where I am actually contibuting to software. Front end software to be precise, if that's still a viable career path with the state of the world right now.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <i><b>assess and prepapre for next steps</b></i> &bull; What do I need to do to begin my career post-graduation? Not sure. Maybe get some certifications. Maybe start mass-applying to jobs like everyone else. Hard not to have doubts.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <i><b>thrive</b></i> &bull; I guess I just. Make good websites, eventually. My real goal is to get my graphic novel published. I am only doing this because illustration is not a viable career in America. It is overseas, though. My actual career goal is to learn one or two more languages, leave here and go somewhere else.
                  <!-- In all honesty the reason I am doing this is because late capitalism is hostile to the arts. I tried to make a living as a digital artist and that wound up with me becoming a shut-in for 3-4 years during Covid-19, and then promptly getting evicted because I couldn't pay my rent in time from my pitiful commission money. If animation studios still hired people here instead of outsourcing childslaves in the phillipines I could be contributing to something. But nope. Everyone wants to make endless growth, endless profit in this hellscape by any means necessary. Antisocial behavior is rewarded in this society. America really hates intellectualism and glorifies how efficient you are at taking advantage of those around you, how much energy you suck out of the ecosystem. Any creative work is seen as juvenile. The good thing, I know, is that this hollow attitude is exlusive to America, for the most part. It's 2025. The rest of the world retains its appreciation for the arts. So who knows. I'll go with this web dev career as my source of income and hopefully get my graphic novel that I've been sitting on published. My ACTUAL goal, not my bullshit goal, is to learn one or two other languages, get a visa, and to leave. That's it. -->
